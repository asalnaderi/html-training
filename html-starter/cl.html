                Dear Hiring Manager,<br><br>
                I am writing to express my interest in opportunities within your organization. With a background in sport science and a current focus on IT studies, I am excited about the potential to contribute my skills and passion for technology to your team as a junior candidate.
                Over the years, my career path has evolved from sport science to the dynamic field of information technology. This transition has been driven by my genuine curiosity and eagerness to work in a field that constantly challenges and excites me.
                In my previous roles, I have demonstrated a keen ability to quickly adapt to new applications and solutions. I thrive in environments that encourage learning and growth, traits that have propelled me towards pursuing certifications and courses such as Python, ITIL4, Bash scripting, Linux, HTML, and GitHub. While it has been a six-month journey, I am confident that my dedication will make me significantly proficient within the next year.
                What sets me apart is my thoughtful approach to problem-solving and my commitment to staying updated with the latest advancements in technology. I am driven by the opportunity to explore new and exciting services, contributing innovative ideas that drive business success. Moreover, my background in sport science has instilled in me a strong work ethic, teamwork skills, and a drive for excellence, all of which are transferable to the IT sector.
                I am particularly drawn to opportunities within organizations like yours because of the potential for growth and learning. Your commitment to innovation, collaboration resonates with my own values of continuous learning and growth.
                It's worth noting that I do not require any visa sponsorship to remain in the UK as I have valid work permission.
                Thank you for considering my application. I am eager for the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasm align with the goals of your organization. Please find my CV attached for your consideration.<br><br>
                Warm Regards<br>
